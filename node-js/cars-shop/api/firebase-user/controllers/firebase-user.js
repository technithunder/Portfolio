//* https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization.html#controllers
//& Controllers are JavaScript files containing sets of methods called actions that you can access by requesting a specific route...
//* See here: https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization.html#custom-controllers
//& In the example in the link above, there is a basic example where a GET request to /hello would return or send back a string
//& containing the word "Hello World".
//* See here: https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization.html#core-controllers
//& In the link above, it states that any time you create a new content type, a new set of controllers is created and strapi builds all the default controllers
//& for us, but then gives us a file that we can use to extend them or add custom ones to our own / override the default logic...
//& At 1:52 he mentions that this is why he sees the "Controllers" as "Custom logic living at end points that we can use to interact with the app's content"

//& The default controllers created for us include find, findOne, count, create, update, and delete as seen here:
//* https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization.html#collection-type
//& If you look into what "find" does for example, it enables the endpoint for our GET request to properly function!
//& More specifically, what it does is it executes the "find" controller which goes and uses Strapi "services" to retrieve the data
//& Strapi "services" are other functions which Strapi has built that allows searching for a specific collection type (same as Content Type) query,
//& Or simply listing all of the available data for a specific collection type (same as Content Type)

//& CONTROLLERS SIMPLY CONTROL THE LOGIC AT SPECIFIC ENDPOINTS! (see above)

//* For comment below: https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization.html#collection-type
//& At 6:26 he shows how they will copy the logic within "create" of the Collection Type example, and add it to your own controller file, and then you can go ahead &
//& add whatever code you want to extend it, and then Strapi will use your newly defined version

//* For comment below: https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/guides/is-owner.html#create-is-owner-policy
//& At 7:00 he goes into the creation process of the "is owner" policy which extends a core controller

//* For comment below: https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization.html#utils
//& Here it shows that parseMultipartData from 'strapi-utils' is a function that is used to parse the data from the request body aka parses Strapi's formData format
//& and then it returns a JSON object with the data that was sent in the request body (aka the formData)
//& Also, sanitizeEntity from 'strapi-utils' is a function that removes all private fields from the model and its relations

const { parseMultipartData, sanitizeEntity } = require('strapi-utils');
